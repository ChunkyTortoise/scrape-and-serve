## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8, enforced by `ruff`
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Add docstrings to public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines

## Testing

- Place tests in `tests/` directory
- Name test files `test_*.py`
- Use descriptive test names that explain expected behavior
- Run the full suite before submitting: `make test`

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation if needed
- Reference related issues in the PR description
